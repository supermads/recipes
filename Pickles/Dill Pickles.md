# Dill Pickles #

Makes 1 Quart

## Ingredients ##

- 1 lb Pickling or Quark Cucumbers, or 1-2 Large Cucumbers, sliced
- 2-3 Cloves Garlic, Crushed 
- 1 Large Handful Fresh Dill
- 2 c Filtered Water
- 1 T Pure Sea Salt

## Instructions ##

1. Make brine: 
    - Heat 1 c water in microwave for 30 seconds, or until warm.  
    - Stir salt into the water until it is all dissolved.  
    - Stir in remaining cup of water and set aside to cool while you prep the cucumbers.
2. Wash cucumbers and slice if using large cucumbers.
3. In a quart sized wide-mouth jar, add crushed garlic, cucumbers, and dill, making sure to leave a few inches of empty space at the top of the jar.
4. Cover the cucumber mixture with brine until it is just covered.
5. Place fermenting weight in the jar so that it pushes all of the cucumbers, dill, and garlic under the brine. 
6. Make sure to leave at least an inch of space between the top of the brine and the top of the jar.  Pour off any excess brine.
7. Cover jar with a pickle pipe or airlock and place somewhere cool and away from direct sunlight to ferment.
8. After about 3 days, open the jar and check for any foul smells, mold, or other undesirable growth. If you find any, you can usually just scrape it off and continue fermenting as long as it does not return later.  When in doubt, Google is your friend.
9. Once a day or so, starting at day 3 for sliced cucumbers or day 7 for full cucumbers, try a sliced pickle or part of a full cucumber.   Repeat until the pickles have reached your desired flavor.
10. Move the jar to the fridge.  You can now take out the fermenting weight and replace the pickle pipe with a metal lid if desired.
