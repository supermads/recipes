# Fermented Radishes #

Makes 1 Quart

## Ingredients ##

- 2 Bunches of Organic Radishes (Any Kind), Greens Removed
- 3 c Filtered Water
- 1 1/2 T Pure Sea Salt

## Instructions ##

1. Make brine: 
    - Heat 1 c water in microwave for 30 seconds, or until warm.  
    - Stir salt into the water until it is all dissolved.  
    - Stir in remaining 2 cups of water and set aside to cool while you prep the carrots.
2. Scrub radishes well with vegetable scrubber.
3. Slice radishes into 1/4-1/2 in rounds.
4. In a quart sized wide-mouth jar, add radish slices, making sure to leave a few inches of empty space at the top of the jar.
5. Cover the radish slices with brine until they are just covered.
6. Place fermenting weight in the jar so that it pushes all of the carrot sticks under the brine. 
7. Make sure to leave at least an inch of space between the top of the brine and the top of the jar.  Pour off any excess brine.
8. Cover jar with a pickle pipe or airlock and place somewhere cool and away from direct sunlight to ferment.
9. After about 3 days, open the jar and check for any foul smells, mold, or other undesirable growth. If you find any, you can usually just scrape it off and continue fermenting as long as it does not return later.  When in doubt, Google is your friend.
10. Once a day, starting at day 3, try a radish slice.   Repeat until the radishes have reached your desired flavor (mine usually take about 7 days).
11. Move the jar to the fridge.  You can now take out the fermenting weight and replace the pickle pipe with a metal lid if desired.
