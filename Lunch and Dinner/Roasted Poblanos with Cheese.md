# Roasted Poblanos with Cheese #

Makes 4 Servings

## Ingredients ##

- 4  Poblano Peppers
- 8 oz Block Monterey Jack or Low-Moisture Mozzerella Cheese
- Salt to taste
 
## Instructions ##

1. Preheat oven to 450Â° F.
2. Rinse and dry poblanos. Cut off the top and remove the seed cluster inside.
3. Cut the block of cheese into four pieces and stuff a piece into each pepper.
4. Roast the cheese-filled peppers in the oven for 5-8 minutes, or until the skin starts to char and the cheese begins to melt.
5. Slice or chop up the peppers as desired and add salt to taste. 
6. Eat by themselves or as a filling for tacos or omelettes! They keep well in the fridge for at least 2-3 days, so you can roast a batch and then use as desired over the next few days.
