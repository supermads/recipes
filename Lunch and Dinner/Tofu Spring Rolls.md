# Tofu Spring Rolls #

Makes About 9 Spring Rolls

## Ingredients ##

- 16 oz Firm Tofu
- 1 tsp Sesame Oil
- 1 tsp Soy Sauce, plus extra for serving
- 1 tsp Maple Syrup or Honey
- 1/4 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1/2 tsp Roasted Chicken Flavor Better Than Bouillon (optional)
- 2 tsp Olive Oil, divided
- 16 oz Coleslaw Mix
- 9 Spring Roll Wrappers
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions ##

1. Press tofu for at least 15 minutes using a tofu press or towel and heavy pan to remove excess water.
2. In a small to medium bowl, make a marinade by combining sesame oil, soy sauce, maple syrup/honey, garlic powder, and bouillon, if using.
3. Crumble up tofu and add to the marinade. Let sit while you cook the rest of the spring roll filling.
4. Heat 1 tsp olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
5. Add the coleslaw mix to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until it has softed and started to brown, about 8-10 minutes.
6. Once the veggies are cooked, add a pinch of salt and pepper and a splash of soy sauce, if desired.
7. Remove the veggies from the pan and place in a large  bowl. Lower the heat to medium.
8. Add tofu to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is heated through and lightly browned. 
9. Remove pan from the heat and add the tofu to the cooked veggies.  Taste the filling and add additional seasoning as desired.
10. Use the spring roll package instructions to assemble the spring rolls, putting about 1/9 of the filling in each roll.
11. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat with the remaining 1 tsp olive oil.
12. Add spring rolls to the pan (it will probably take 2 batches) and cook for a few minutes on each side, until the sides are browned and crisp.  Alternately, you can try frying or baking the rolls.
13. Eat with soy sauce or other sauce of choice.
