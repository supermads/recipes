## Ingredients ##

Makes About 24 Tacos

### Ingredients ###

-1 Tbsp Olive Oil
-1 Large Onion, chopped (about 2c)
-1 15.5 oz Can Kidney Beans, drained and rinsed
-1 15 oz Can Black Beans, drained and rinsed
-1 Tbsp Ground Cumin
-1 tsp Garlic Powder 
-0.80 lb Cooked Chicken Breast, shredded
-1 Scoop Spinach Powder or 1 c Fresh Spinach
-160 g Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese, shredded (About 1.5 cups) 
-24 Small Corn Tortillas
-Salt and Pepper to Taste

## Instructions: ##

1. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat and add olive oil.
2. Once the  pan is hot, add the chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they’re lightly browned. Add a pinch of salt and a bit of pepper.
3. Add all of the beans to the pan and add the cumin and garlic powder. Stir, then cook for 1-2 minutes and stir again. 
4. Cook for a few more minutes, until the beans start to soften. Use the back of your spatula to smash some of the beans and make the mixture a bit more cohesive.
5. Turn off the heat and mix in the spinach powder (or spinach) and shredded chicken.
6. Get out a large, heat-safe bowl and add everything from the pan into it. 
7. Add about ½  of the cheese to the  bowl  and reserve the rest for topping the  tacos.  
8. Make sure everything in the  bowl is well combined then preheat a griddle or pan over medium heat  (about 250° F if making tacos for later or 300° F if eating right away).
9. Add 6 tortillas  (or as many as fit on the griddle/pan you’re working with) to the griddle/pan.
10. Leave for about 10 sec, or until the tortilla starts to steam and then carefully flip it.
11. Add about 2 heaping tablespoons of  the filling to one half of each tortilla.
12. Top each of the tortillas with a little of the reserved cheese.
13. Fold the empty side of the tortilla over the filling side then push down gently until the taco sticks together.
14. Remove the tacos from the griddle/pan and place on a sheet pan two wide and leaning up against each other (I like to use the Anova pan for this so the tacos fit into the grooves of the pan).
15. Continue assembling tacos until all of the filling has been used then let the pan of tacos cool for 15-30 minutes.
16. Place the pan of tacos in the freezer for a couple hours until they’re mostly frozen then remove the tacos from the pan and place in a  freezer bag or other storage container.
17. To reheat: Air fry/bake at 400° for about 10 minutes or microwave for about 2 minutes, flipping halfway through for either method.
18. Serve with pickled red onions, hummus, sour cream, salsa, or whatever you'd like!
