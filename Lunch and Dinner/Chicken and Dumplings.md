## Instructions: ##

1. Melt butter in large pot over medium high heat.
2. Add onions, carrots, and celery (if using) and cook for about 5 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Sprinkle in flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
5. While stirring, add in chicken broth and half and half.
6. Bring soup to a boil then add shredded chicken, pepper, and thyme (if using).
7. Turn down the heat slightly and let soup simmer while you make the dumplings.
8. For the dumplings, combine flour, baking powder, pepper, salt, and thyme in a medium sized bowl.
9. Add milk and melted butter to the flour mixture and mix until just combined.  If the dough seems too dry, add another splash of milk.
10. If using peas, add them to the soup.
11. Spoon egg-sized portions of the dumpling dough onto the top of the soup, trying to keep them separated.
12. Push down gently on the dumplings to let the soup run over them.
13. Turn the heat down to medium low (or low if the soup is at a rapid boil) and cover your pot with a lid.
14. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until the tops and middle of the dumplings are cooked through.
