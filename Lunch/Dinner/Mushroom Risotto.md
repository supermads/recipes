# Mushroom Risotto #

Serves 4-6 People

## Ingredients ##
- 2 T Olive Oil
- 1/4 c Unsalted Butter
- 1 Large Onion, Finely Chopped
- 12 oz Baby Bella or Button Mushrooms, Finely Chopped
- 1 t Minced Garlic (About 2 Cloves)
- 2/3 c White Wine
- 8 c Low Sodium Chicken Broth, Warmed<sup>*</sup>
- 1 1/2 c Arborio Rice or Other Short-Grain White Rice
- 2/3 c Grated Parmesan Cheese
- 1 c Frozen Peas, optional

## Instructions ##

1. Add butter and olive oil to a large pan over medium heat.  
2. Once the butter is melted, add onions and saute until the onions are tender, about 8 minutes.
3. Add mushrooms and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in rice and let it toast for 2-3 minutes, making sure it doesn’t get too dark.
5. Pour wine into the pan, stir, and let cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.
6. Lower the heat to medium low (or low if the pan is getting too hot). 
7. Add about a cup of broth to the pan and cook until most of the broth is absorbed, stirring often. 
8. Continue to add broth about a cup at a time, stirring and making sure broth is absorbed before adding more, until rice is tender and the risotto is a creamy consistency. Stir in peas, if using.
9. Remove from heat and stir in parmesan cheese.
10. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

<sup>*</sup>To warm the broth, I will usually microwave 2 cups at a time on high for 2 minutes.  You can wait until you’re toasting the rice to start, so the broth will still be warm when you add it to the pan.  Heating isn’t necessary, but it helps the rice cook more consistently. Room temperature broth will cool down the risotto every time you add another cup to the pan, so it’ll take longer for the rice to absorb it.
