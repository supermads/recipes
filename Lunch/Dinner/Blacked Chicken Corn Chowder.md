3. Stir in potato, pepper, celery, and corn. Cook until slightly soft, about 10 minutes. If vegetables begin to stick to bottom of pot, lower heat slightly.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. While vegetables are cooking, prepare blackened chicken and reserve:

    - Add chicken, one piece at a time, to dish and coat completely with seasoning.
    - Add olive oil to saut√© pan and heat over medium-high to high heat for a few minutes, or until sizzling is heard when chicken is added. Make sure oil does not smoke or burn.
    - Cook chicken pieces in pan, about 3 minutes on each side, or until the outside of the chicken is dark but not burnt and chicken is cooked through. Reduce heat if pan gets too hot.
5. Stir flour into vegetables to coat them.  Cook for 1 minute. 
6. Add chicken broth, making sure to scrape off any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. 
7. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Add parsely. 
8. Stir in chicken and reduce heat to low. 
9. Add half-and-half and simmer on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until ready to serve.  Do not keep heat on for more than 20 minutes after half-and-half is added.
