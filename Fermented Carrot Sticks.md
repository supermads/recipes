# Fermented Carrot Sticks #

Makes 1 Quart

## Ingredients ##

- 1 Large Bag Organic Carrots
- 2-3 Cloves Garlic, Crushed 
- 2 Cups Filtered Water
- 1 Tablespoon Sea Salt

## Instructions ##

1. Make brine: 
    - Heat water in microwave for 1 minute, or until warm.  
    - Stir salt into the water until it is all dissolved.  
    - Set aside to cool while you prep the carrots.
2. Scrub carrots well with vegetable scrubber.
3. Cut carrots into small sticks of about the same size.
4. In a quart sized wide-mouth jar, add crushed garlic and carrot sticks.
5. Cover the carrots and garlic with brine until they are just covered.
6. Place fermenting weight in the jar so that it pushes all of the carrot sticks under the brine. 
7. Make sure to leave at least an inch of space between the top of the brine and the top of the jar.  Pour off any excess brine.
8. Cover jar with a pickle pipe or airlock and place somewhere cool and away from direct sunlight to ferment.
9. After about 3 days, open the jar and check for any foul smells, mold, or other undesirable growth. If you find any, you can usually just scrape it off and continue fermenting as long as it does not return later.  When in doubt, Google is your friend.
10. Once a day, starting at day 2-3, try a carrot stick.   Repeat until the carrots have reached your desired flavor (mine usually take about 5 days).
10. Move the jar to the fridge.  You can now take out the fermenting weight and replace the pickle pipe with a normal lid if desired.
