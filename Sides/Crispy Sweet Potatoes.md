# Crispy Sweet Potatoes #
Ingredients:

- 1 lb Sweet potato, cubed (I buy them pre-cubed)
- 4 T Olive Oil 
- 1/2 t Salt 
- 1/4 t Pepper 
- 1 t Paprika (optional) 
- Additional salt &#38; pepper for seasoning 

Instructions:

1. Add sweet potato cubes to a colander and rinse with water.
2. Pour olive oil evenly over sweet potatoes, gently shaking colander to drain excess oil.
3. Add salt, pepper, and paprika (if using) to sweet potato mixture. Use a spoon or gently shake colander to spread seasoning evenly.
4. Put sweet potato mixture in air fryer and set to 400&#176;F. If baking, pour sweet potato mixture onto sheet tray and add to preheated 400&#176;F oven.
5. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so, until sweet potatoes are lightly brown and crispy.
6. Salt and pepper to taste.
