# Breakfast Burritos #

Makes 2 Burritos

## Ingredients ##

- 1 1/2 c Frozen Shredded Hashbrowns
- 2 T Olive Oil
- 3 Slices Thick-cut Bacon (optional)
- 4 Eggs
- Splash of Milk (optional)
- Pat of Butter
- 2 10" Flour Tortillas
- 1/2 c Refried Beans, Warmed
- 1/2 c Shredded Cheddar Cheese

## Instructions ##

1. In a large pan, heat olive oil and prepare hashbrowns according to package instructions.
2. While hashbrowns are cooking, scramble eggs with milk, if using.
3. Cook bacon, if using.  To do this, put slices in a large pan and cook over medium to medium high heat, flipping, until crispy.
3. When hashbrowns are done, move them onto a plate and return pan to stove (heat off).
4. Add butter to pan.
5. Pour scrambled eggs into the pan and cook, stirring, until desired doneness. You can turn the heat back on if the pan's residual heat is not enough to fully cook the eggs.
6. Once eggs are done, season with salt and pepper to taste and move onto a plate. You can put them on the same plate as the hashbrowns if they fit side-by-side.
7. Put a tortilla in the pan to warm it up, flipping once.
8. Put warmed tortilla on a plate and assemble the first burrito: 
    - Spread refried beans on tortilla.
    - Add half of hashbrowns to the center line of the tortilla.
    - Pour half of eggs on top of hasbrowns.
    - If using bacon, crumble 1 1/2 slices on top of eggs.
    - Sprinkle cheddar cheese on top.
    - Roll up burrito.  
9. Place pan over medium high heat and warm second tortilla.
10. Meanwhile, assemble second burrito.
11. Toast both burritos over medium high heat until golden brown, turning occasionally, until brown.  You can turn off the heat once the first side is done to reduce the chance of over toasting the burritos.
